# Development Commands

## Setup and Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install specific PDF dependencies
uv pip install pymupdf4llm PyPDF2
```

## Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=berry_pdf_mcp tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_decorators.py -v

# Run tests in watch mode (if pytest-watch is installed)
ptw tests/
```

## Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/ examples/

# Check formatting
black --check src/ tests/ examples/

# Lint code
ruff check src/ tests/ examples/

# Fix linting issues
ruff check --fix src/ tests/ examples/

# Type checking
mypy src/berry_pdf_mcp/

# Type checking with verbose output
mypy --verbose src/berry_pdf_mcp/
```

## Running the Server
```bash

# Run example usage
python examples/server_usage.py
```

## Development Workflow
```bash
# Full quality check before commit
black src/ tests/ examples/ && ruff check src/ tests/ examples/ && mypy src/ && pytest tests/

# Quick test run
pytest tests/ -x --tb=short

# Run examples to test functionality
python examples/server_usage.py
```

## Build and Distribution
```bash
# Build package
python -m build

# Check package
twine check dist/*

# Install locally for testing
uv pip install -e .
```
